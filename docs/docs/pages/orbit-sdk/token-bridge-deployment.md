This guide outlines the process to deploy `token bridge contracts` for your Orbit chain using the Orbit SDK. As highlighted in the [introduction page](introduction.md), deploying a token bridge is a crucial step after initializing your Orbit chain, enabling the bridging of ERC-20 tokens to and from your Orbit chain.

For a practical approach, we recommend the following examples from the Orbit SDK repository:

- For Orbit chains using ETH as the native token, explore [this ETH token bridge deployment example](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-orbit-sdk/blob/main/examples/create-token-bridge-eth/index.ts).
- For Custom fee token Orbit chains, refer to [this custom fee token bridge deployment example](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-orbit-sdk/blob/main/examples/create-token-bridge-custom-fee-token/index.ts).

These resources are designed for users who prefer a hands-on learning experience. Ensure you're familiar with the prerequisites mentioned in the introduction before proceeding.
