#### Setting Up an Anytrust Orbit Chain Using Orbit SDK

::::steps

### Prepare the Configuration

Similar to the Rollup chain, you'll need to prepare the chain configuration, focusing on parameters that are specific to Anytrust chains.

### Use Orbit SDK APIs

The Orbit SDK provides APIs tailored for Anytrust chain deployment. These APIs might differ slightly from those used for Rollup chains, reflecting the unique aspects of Anytrust chains.

### Deploy the Chain

Utilize the Orbit SDK to deploy your Anytrust chain. This process will involve sending transactions and setting up the necessary smart contracts on the parent chain.

### Setting Anytrust Keyset

In the deployment of an Anytrust Orbit chain, a crucial step involves defining and setting up the Data Availability Committee (DAC) keyset. This keyset, comprising keys from the appointed members of the DAC, is essential for ensuring data availability and integrity. Once you have selected your committee members and gathered their keys, these keys are then configured into a keyset using the Orbit SDK. This keyset is subsequently embedded into the chain, serving as a verification mechanism to maintain the trust and security of the Anytrust chain. The proper configuration and deployment of this keyset are vital for the effective operation and reliability of the Anytrust model within the Arbitrum Orbit framework.
