# Arbitrum Orbit SDK

## Setup fee distributor contract

By default, individual addresses are set to collect each of the fee types of an Orbit chain. However, some chains may require multiple addresses to receive the collected fees of any of the available types. In those cases, there's the possibility of using a distributor contract that can gather all fees of a specific type and distribute those among multiple addresses.

This example shows how to configure a distributor contract to manage the Orbit base fees of a chain. You can also use this same example to configure additional distributor contracts to manage other fee types.

You can find more information about the different fee types, and how to configure other fee types in [How to manage fee collector addresses](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/manage-fee-collectors)

## Variables needed

- ROLLUP_ADDRESS: address of the Rollup contract
- CHAIN_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY: private key of the account with executor privileges in the UpgradeExecutor admin contract for the chain
- ORBIT_CHAIN_ID: chainId of the Orbit chain
- ORBIT_CHAIN_RPC: RPC of the Orbit chain
- PARENT_CHAIN_ID: chainId of the parent chain
- RECIPIENT_ADDRESSES: Array of addresses to configure in the distributor contract
- RECIPIENT_WEIGHTS: Array of weights of each of the configured addresses

## How to configure the distribution addresses in the .env file

The .env file contains two arrays: RECIPIENT_ADDRESSES and RECIPIENT_WEIGHTS. The first one will have the addresses that will receive the amounts that the distributor contract receives. The second one will define the weights of each of those addresses. For example, if one recipient has a weight of 75%, they will receive 75% of the amount held in the contract at the time of distribution. Both arrays must have the same length.

Weights are expressed in percentages multiplied by 100. For example, to allocate 12,5% of the amount to a specific recipient, you'll define the weight as 1250. To allocate 80%, you'll define the weight as 8000.

You can configure as many recipients as you wish.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Create .env file and add the env vars

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Run the example
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
